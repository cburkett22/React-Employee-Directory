## Description
As a Full-Stack Web Developer, I have created an application that will allow a user to view an entire employee directory at once. I have created this application so that the user has quick access to their information. In order to achieve this, I will implement a React application and a Material Design Bootstrap table.

## Table of Contents

* [Title](#Title)
* [Description](#Description)
* [Usage](#Usage)

## Usage
